# Codeforces Solutions Repository

Welcome to the Codeforces Solutions Repository! This is a place for people to share their solutions to Codeforces problems.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute your solution to a Codeforces problem, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new folder (IF IT DOES NOT EXIST BEFORE) for each problem that you want to contribute a solution to. The folder should be named using the Codeforces problem ID (e.g. 50A, 1774H, etc.).

2. Make sure your solution is correct before submitting it. Test your solution against the provided test cases to ensure that it is correct.

## Optional

3. Include a README file inside each folder. The README should contain a brief description of the problem and your solution. You can also include any additional notes or thoughts about the problem or your solution.

4. Use proper code formatting when including your solution in the README file. You can use markdown syntax to format your code blocks.
